# Installation Guide

## Geodiversity Tools for ArcGIS Pro

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing and using the Geodiversity Tools toolbox in ArcGIS Pro.

---

## 1. Download the Repository

1. Open the project page on GitHub.
2. Click **Code → Download ZIP**.
3. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice (e.g., `C:\GeodiversityTools`).

You should now have a directory structure similar to:

GeodiversityTools/
├── Docs/
├── Scripts/
├── Symbology/
├── TestData/
├── Toolbox/
│ └── GeodiversityTools.atbx
└── README.md

---

## 2. Add Toolbox to ArcGIS Pro

1. Open **ArcGIS Pro**.
2. Open any project.
3. Go to the **Catalog** pane.
4. Right-click **Toolboxes → Add Toolbox**.
5. Browse to:
   ...\GeodiversityTools\Toolbox\GeodiversityTools.atbx

6. Confirm.

The toolbox will now appear in your Toolboxes list.

---

## 3. Configure Script Paths (if needed)

Tools may reference external Python script files located in:
...\GeodiversityTools\scripts\

If you move the repository, update script paths:

1. Right-click a script .py file → **Properties**.
2. Go to **Execution**.
3. Update the **Script File** location.
4. Save.

---

## 4. Test the Installation

Run any tool (e.g., _R_SD_) on a sample DEM raster and polygon grid layer.

If you encounter an error:

- ensure that raster paths contain no special characters,
- check whether the path to the \GeodiversityTools folder is not too long,
- verify that the input data — including feature types and attribute field types — comply with the requirements of the tool,
- check that statistics, temporary, and raster folders are writable,
- after an unsuccessful tool run, check the geodatabase and the analytical grid attribute table for any remaining temporary intermediate feature classes or fields,
- check the messages generated by the tool during execution in ArcGIS Pro and address any issues encountered.

---

## 5. Optional: Install Python Dependencies

All tools use the default ArcGIS Pro Python environment (`arcpy`).
No additional installation is required.

---

## 6. Updating the Toolbox

To update to a newer version:

1. Download the new version from GitHub.
2. Replace old toolbox + scripts.
3. Restart ArcGIS Pro.
